Code Review:

I reviewed your code Giuditta and its working awesome.
Really liked the way you used comments at each step.You have used user defined functions and random function very appropriately.
Your terminology approach towards the aim is appreciable. 
Great job.


Suggestion: 

1.Number of Rounds:
  you can simply store number of rounds in a variable and make use of for loop with range.
  example:
	no = int(input("how many times you want your loop to work"))
	for i in range(0,no):
		print(" loop is working ", i)
 so here you can simply put the logic to take input from user and to call score calculating function inside the loop. 

2. In random.choice() function we can directly pass list of strings. 
   This will shorten your code i.e there will be no need of random function you used.
   example:
	lst = ['r','p','s']
	computer_inp = random.choice(lst)

3. you correctly used elif statement to define the rules. To make the code more optimized and for level 2 you can - make two variables to store score of player and computer individually. Then simply compare which one have greater score.
   example:
	
	# to use these variables inside local function you will need to make use of global keyword concept
	player_score = 0
	computer_score = 0

	# the below is example on how to add score according to game rule. Apply similar to other rules you defined in result function as well 
	if player_inp = 'r' and computer_inp ='s':
		player_score= player_score + 1

	# considering you added scores according to above example
	if player_score == computer_score:
		print("Its a draw")
	elif player_score > computer_score:
		print(" player wins")
	else:
		print("computer wins")


Suggestions in your code for level 2:

if you implement 2nd suggestion i gave you earlier your task will become more easy.

HINT - As you have to repeat the whole procedure till user ask to exit its clear you need to use a loop with condition.
Here you can use while loop.

I am mentioning an example here if you want to try loop on your own dont look below or else you can take reference form it.
example:

value = True
while value is True:
    print("hey")
    new_value = int(input("1 to continue and 2 to exit"))
    if new_value == 2:
        value = False

# this loop will stop working when value will set to False as it will not satisfy the while condition anymore. You can simply put the game logic inside the loop.

Hope this helps you. Happy learning :)
